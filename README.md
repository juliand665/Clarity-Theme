# Clarity Theme
An Xcode theme with light and dark variants.

### Features

* Light and Dark theme for all hours of the day!
* Dynamically-spaced font for improved comment/documentation readability.
* Distinguish between your own identifiers and those from libraries by color.
* All varieties of identifiers have different colors.

### Installation

Simply drag the .xccolortheme files you'd like into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`.

Feel free to customize anything you don't like :)

### Screenshots

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src=Images/bright.png /></td>
    <td><img src=Images/mellow.png /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center">
    <td>bright variant</td>
    <td>mellow variant</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Notes

The bright theme is great for daytime because light colors cause less glare, but it lacks contrast when Night Shift or Flux are active; that's when I recommend switching to the mellow theme.
